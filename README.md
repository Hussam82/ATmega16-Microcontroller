# ATmega16-Microcontroller
## Implemnting many drivers and doing some AVR based projects
## All of these codes are built by using Eclipse IDE with AVR-Plugin and AVR toolchain installed and simulated by using Proteus
## This repository contains some implemented drivers as:
#### 1- ADC
#### 2- Button
#### 3- Buzzer
#### 4- External EEPROM
#### 5- GPIO
#### 6- I2C
#### 7- ICU
#### 8- Keypad
#### 9- LCD
#### 10- LED
#### 11- LM35 Sensor
#### 12- PWM
#### 13- Seven Segment
#### 14- SPI
#### 15- Timer
#### 16- Ultrasonic
#### 17- USART
## Also it includes some projects made using these drivers and simulated by using Proteus Software as:
#### 1- Basic Stopwatch
#### 2- Fan controller System
#### 3- Distance Measuring using Ultrasonic
#### 4- Door locking system
